üöÄ Key Features | ÿßŸÑŸÖŸäÿ≤ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ¶Ÿäÿ≥Ÿäÿ©
This is not just another simple scanner. It integrates advanced techniques and a robust framework to deliver near commercial-grade results.
Ÿáÿ∞Ÿá ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿØÿßÿ© ŸÑŸäÿ≥ÿ™ ŸÖÿ¨ÿ±ÿØ ŸÖÿßÿ≥ÿ≠ ÿ®ÿ≥Ÿäÿ∑ ÿ¢ÿÆÿ±ÿå ÿ®ŸÑ ÿ™ÿØŸÖÿ¨ ÿ™ŸÇŸÜŸäÿßÿ™ ŸÖÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖÿ© Ÿàÿ•ÿ∑ÿßÿ± ÿπŸÖŸÑ ŸÇŸàŸäÿßŸã ŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸäŸÖ ŸÜÿ™ÿßÿ¶ÿ¨ ÿ™ŸÇÿ™ÿ±ÿ® ŸÖŸÜ ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ŸàŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿØŸàÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ¨ÿßÿ±Ÿäÿ©.
üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection | ÿßŸÉÿ™ÿ¥ÿßŸÅ ÿ¥ÿßŸÖŸÑ ŸÑŸÑÿ´ÿ∫ÿ±ÿßÿ™:
Injection Flaws: SQL Injection (Error-based, Time-based), Command Injection (Blind, Time-based), SSTI, LFI.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Reflected & Stored XSS with intelligent payload reflection analysis to reduce false positives.
Out-of-Band Detection (OAST): Advanced detection for blind vulnerabilities like Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
Configuration & Information Disclosure: Checks for sensitive files (.env, .git), verbose headers, and security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.).
üß† Advanced Business Logic Module | Ÿàÿ≠ÿØÿ© ŸÖÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖÿ© ŸÑŸÅÿ≠ÿµ ŸÖŸÜÿ∑ŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÖŸÑ:
The Crown Jewel! Define multi-step attack workflows in simple JSON files.
Test for complex vulnerabilities like IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) and privilege escalation flaws that traditional scanners miss.
Automatically extract context (like session tokens or user IDs) from one step and use it in another.
‚öôÔ∏è High-Performance & Scalable Architecture | ÿ®ŸÜŸäÿ© ÿπÿßŸÑŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿØÿßÿ° ŸàŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ÿπ:
Fully Asynchronous: Utilizes ThreadPoolExecutor to run modules and network requests concurrently for maximum speed.
Redis-Powered: Centralized state management using Redis for real-time progress tracking, allowing the application to scale across multiple workers (e.g., using Gunicorn).
Optimized HTTP Sessions: Custom HTTPAdapter with increased connection pooling to handle high-concurrency scans without bottlenecks.
üîê Secure-by-Design Application Framework | ÿ•ÿ∑ÿßÿ± ÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿ¢ŸÖŸÜ ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿµŸÖŸäŸÖ:
Robust Authentication: Password hashing (PBKDF2), complexity policies, and brute-force protection (account lockout).
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): TOTP-based 2FA for enhanced account security.
CSRF Protection: Integrated into all forms via Flask-WTF.
Secure Dependencies: Uses environment variables for all secrets and configurations.
üìä User-Friendly Interface & Reporting | Ÿàÿßÿ¨Ÿáÿ© ÿ≥ŸáŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿÆÿØÿßŸÖ Ÿàÿ™ŸÇÿßÿ±Ÿäÿ± ÿßÿ≠ÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸÅŸäÿ©:
Real-time Scan Progress: A live-updating dashboard shows scan progress and a detailed log.
Dynamic Translation: Reports can be viewed in both English and Arabic with on-the-fly text translation.
Professional PDF Reports: Generate detailed, multilingual security assessment reports ready for stakeholders.
Data Visualization: Interactive doughnut charts to summarize vulnerability severity.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack | ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇŸÜŸäÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿÆÿØŸÖÿ©
Backend: Python, Flask, Waitress (WSGI Server)
Database: SQLAlchemy (compatible with PostgreSQL & SQLite)
Async & State: Redis

üèÅ Getting Started | ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿØÿ°
Follow these steps to get the scanner up and running on your local machine.
ÿßÿ™ÿ®ÿπ Ÿáÿ∞Ÿá ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ∑Ÿàÿßÿ™ ŸÑÿ™ÿ¥ÿ∫ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿßÿ≥ÿ≠ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ¨Ÿáÿßÿ≤ŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ŸÑŸä.
Prerequisites | ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿ∑ŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≥ÿßÿ≥Ÿäÿ©
Python 3.9+
Redis Server: Ensure you have a Redis instance running. See Redis Docs.
wkhtmltopdf: Required for generating PDF reports. Download it from wkhtmltopdf.org and ensure its installation path is added to your system's PATH.
Google Chrome: Required for Selenium-based automated login.
Installation & Setup | ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ´ÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ•ÿπÿØÿßÿØ
Clone the repository:
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ethical-security-scanner.git
cd ethical-security-scanner
Use code with caution.
Bash
Create and activate a virtual environment:
Generated bash
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install the required Python packages:
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt in your project's activated environment.)
Configure environment variables:
Create a file named .env in the root directory and add the following configurations. Do not commit this file to Git.
Generated env
# Flask Secret Key (generate a long random string)
FLASK_SECRET_KEY='your-very-secret-and-long-random-string'

# Database URL (Example for PostgreSQL, or leave blank for default SQLite)
# DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@localhost/scannerdb'

# Redis URL
REDIS_URL='redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0'

# Email configuration (for account confirmation) - Optional
# MAIL_SERVER='smtp.example.com'
# MAIL_PORT=587
# MAIL_USE_TLS=True
# MAIL_USERNAME='your-email@example.com'
# MAIL_PASSWORD='your-email-password'

# Path to wkhtmltopdf executable (only if not in system PATH)
# WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH='C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe'
Use code with caution.
Env
Initialize the database:
If you are running the application for the first time, set up the database schema.
Generated bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
Use code with caution.
Bash
(Note: This requires Flask-Migrate. You might need to set the FLASK_APP environment variable first: set FLASK_APP=ethical_v5.py on Windows or export FLASK_APP=ethical_v5.py on macOS/Linux.)
Running the Application | ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ∫ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ
With the virtual environment activated, run the application from the terminal:
Generated bash
python ethical_v5.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
The application will be served by Waitress and available at http://127.0.0.1:5003.
